TODO:
Setup system to input remote user's actual IP, Location and ISP to make it look even more legit.

Instructions:
You can compile this code yourself.  It's here to let you know there is nothing
that will mess with your machine.  If you can't compile, you can unzip the FakeSysKey.zip
file in the "_compiled" folder for the latest build file.

After compiling or Unzipping:

	- Navigate to "c:\windows\system32\"
	- Rename "syskey.exe" to something different like "syskey_old.exe" or "syskey.old"
	   - You can delete the file if you want
	- If you compiled the project yourself, rename the FakeSysKey.exe to syskey.exe
	- Copy the files to the "c:\windows\system32\" folder
	- Bait some scammers and hope they freak out!
