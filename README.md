If you can't compile, you can unzip the FakeSysKey.zip file in the "_compiled" folder for the latest build file.

## Instructions

* Navigate to "c:\windows\system32\"
* Rename "syskey.exe" to something different like "syskey_old.exe" or "syskey.old"
* You can delete the file if you want
* If you compiled the project yourself, rename the FakeSysKey.exe to syskey.exe
* Copy the files to the "c:\windows\system32\" folder
* Bait some scammers and hope they freak out!
